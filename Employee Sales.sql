-- 1.Extract Data
CREATE DATABASE employee_sales_data;
USE employee_sales_data;

SELECT * FROM sales_data;



-- 2.Transform Data
--  (1) Data Backup
CREATE TABLE sales_data_staging
LIKE sales_data;

SELECT * FROM sales_data_staging;

INSERT sales_data_staging
SELECT * FROM sales_data;


--  (2) Remove Duplicates
SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY Emp_ID, Emp_Name, SaleDate, SaleAmount) AS row_num
FROM sales_data_staging;

WITH duplicate_staging AS
(SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY Emp_ID, Emp_Name, SaleDate, SaleAmount) AS row_num
FROM sales_data_staging)
SELECT * 
FROM duplicate_staging
WHERE row_num > 1;
-- This dataset contains no duplicates.


--  (3) Standaradize data
SELECT * FROM sales_data_staging;

SELECT DISTINCT Emp_name
FROM sales_data_staging;

-- Convert DATETIME format
SELECT SaleDate,
STR_TO_DATE(SaleDate, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i')
FROM sales_data_staging;

UPDATE sales_data_staging
SET SaleDate = STR_TO_DATE(SaleDate, '%m/%d/%Y %H:%i');

-- Change datatype from TEXT to DATETIME
ALTER TABLE sales_data_staging
MODIFY COLUMN SaleDate DATETIME;

-- Alter the datatype of SaleAmount
ALTER TABLE sales_data_staging
MODIFY COLUMN SaleAmount DECIMAL(10,2);


--  (4) Null Values and Blank Values
SELECT *

WHERE (Emp_ID IS NULL OR ' ')
	OR (Emp_Name IS NULL OR ' ')
	OR (SaleDate IS NULL OR ' ')
    OR (SaleAmount IS NULL OR ' ');

-- 3.Explore Data Analysis

-- Q1.Calculate total sales for each month. (Question from Kaggle dataset)
SELECT SUBSTRING(SaleDate,1 ,7) AS sold_mth, SUM(SaleAmount) AS total_amount

-- Q2.Calculate Sales in the Last 30 Days. (Question from Kaggle dataset)

-- This following SQL query is designed to calculate sales in the last 30 days.
-- However, since the dataset I am working on is from much earlier, there are no recent records within the last 30 days.
SELECT SUM(SaleAmount)
FROM sales_data_staging
WHERE SaleDate >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);

-- Therefore, I calculated the total sales amount for the period between 2024-06-01 and 2024-08-31.
SELECT SUM(SaleAmount)
FROM sales_data_staging
WHERE SaleDate BETWEEN '2024-06-01 00:00:00' AND '2024-08-31 23:59:59';

-- Bonus: Calculate each employee's total sales amount for the three-month period from 2024-06-01 to 2024-08-31.
SELECT Emp_ID, Emp_Name, SUM(SaleAmount)
FROM sales_data_staging

SELECT Emp_ID, Emp_Name, SUM(SaleAmount)
FROM sales_data_staging
GROUP BY Emp_ID, Emp_Name
ORDER BY SUM(SaleAmount) DESC
LIMIT 3;


-- Q6.Find Employees with Sales Above the Average. (Question from Kaggle dataset)
-- Solution 1: CTE+JOIN

-- Note: The JOIN clause can also be used with >, <, and !=.

-- Solution 2: Subquery
